My First Personal Portfolio Website
So far, I know HTML, CSS and JavaScript properly and hence it doesn't have any backend and is a simple static website.
This website is still in the making and as I learn, I'll be pushing the updates.
This project will be completed this month, and then, I'll be working on a new portfolio using React and Firebase.
